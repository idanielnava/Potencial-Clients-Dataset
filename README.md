# Potencial-Clients-Dataset

Data importing, transformation and exploration

DENUE is a public and free to use dataset by INEGI (Mexico's Geography and Statistics Institute) which contains information about all registered businesses

The goal for this project was to evaluate whether this dataset could be of use for prospecting sales, as well as to clean it and make it managable for an average user (since it contains 400k rows and 40+ columns)
